This is my preliminary post to get this project journal started. I am experimenting with GitHub Pages and Jekyll at the moment. I intend on posting all my future projects to this website. 

If you would like to learn how to make your own [GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site) static site, this was the resource I used. Also check out [Jekyll](https://https://jekyllrb.com/).  

Planned Projects:  
    1) The Medical Rinse, working with friends on a health science website.  
    2) Better ME app, motivational Android app.    
    3) Integrum, fitness app (related to The Medical Rinse).
